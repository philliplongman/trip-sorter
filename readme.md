Expansion on an interview question for practice.

Given an array of flights (stored as sub-arrays containing a departure and arrival city) in no particular order, produce an array that lists each city in the trip in order. Assume each city will only appear in the itinerary once.

That is, given:

```
[
  ["CHI", "NYC"],
  ["BOS", "CHI"],
  ["BEJ", "LON"],
  ["NYC", "BEJ"]
]
```

the result should be:

`["BOS", "CHI", "NYC", "BEJ", "LON"]`
